VaultPress is one of the newest <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> projects and is definitely a powerhouse in its field.</p>\n<p>One of the many things that sets VaultPress apart from the rest is its set it and forget it ease of use.  Simply install the VaultPress plugin and watch as it begins to analyze and backup your database, plugins, themes, and uploads.  After the first backup is complete, VaultPress will update your backup whenever a change is made, even for something as trivial as adjusting a setting.  The result is a series of up to the minute full backups ready to be restored as soon as you need them.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <a href="http://www.idrive.com/wordpress.htm">iDrive</a> is VaultPress&#8217; closest competitor.  Though iDrive&#8217;s service starts free, you&#8217;re only allotted 2GB before a paid upgrade is required, and the backups are only generated once every 24 hours.  VaultPress is not free, but space is unlimited and backups occur immediately and as often as necessary.</p>\n<p>In addition to extensive real-time backups, VaultPress offers intuitive stats that use data from your backups to help you determine your blog&#8217;s most popular day and hour (based on % of comments received) and your blog&#8217;s most productive day and hour (based on % of posts published), and if you upgrade to a premium account, VaultPress will regularly scan your files for known exploits and threats. This is an invaluable feature for popular sites as VaultPress will notify you the minute an exploit or threat is found and you&#8217;ll be able to immediately restore from the latest clean backup.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I have not had the need to test the restorability of VaultPress&#8217; backups, but I have determined by visual inspection that they seem to be complete, and <a href="http://vaultpress.com/what-theyre-saying/">several success stories</a> have been recorded.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in need of a simple and complete backup solution, look not further than VaultPress.  VaultPress is still in beta and new features are being added often.  After applying for VaultPress, you&#8217;ll be placed on a waiting list until space is available, but the special beta rates are well worth the wait.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimers: </strong>VaultPress

stats.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The new interface provides real time stats for clicks, views, and podcast downloads, which means you can start seeing what content is drawing traffic from feed readers, Twitter, and other syndicated sources as it happens.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The interface can be accessed by clicking the &#8220;Try out the NEW (beta) version!&#8221; link at the top of your FeedBurner account page.  According to the launch article, &#8220;The best way to see these real time features is to publish a new post and then switch to the &#8216;Last two hours&#8217; view to begin seeing updates.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At this time, the new interface is primarily for the showcasing the new real-time stats.  All other account actions will still need to be done from the old interface.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s your take on the new FeedBurner upgrade? Is this just what FeedBurner needs to bring life back into the service, a step in the wrong direction, or too little too late?</p>\n<a href="http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweblogtoolscollection.com%2F%3Fp%3D8889&count=horizontal&related=weblogtooltips%3Alaughinglizard&text=Google%20Finally%20Updates%20FeedBurner" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 13:00:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"James Huff";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"WP iPhone: Version 2.6.2 Has Been Submitted";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://ios.wordpress.org/?p=872";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"http://ios.wordpress.org/2010/10/25/2-6-2-submitted/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3318:"<p><img class="size-full wp-image-873 alignnone" title="screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-6-39-59-pm" src="http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-6-39-59-pm.png?w=434&#038;h=145" alt="" width="434" height="145" /></p>\n<p>We wanted to let all of you know that we submitted Version 2.6.2 to the App Store tonight.

Props go out to benfremer, cnorris23, dwenaus, erich73, francescolaffi, hempsworth, intimez, jeffsayre, kunalb, paulhastings0, r-a-y, wpmuguru, and everyone else that contributed.

This version of BuddyPress has been one of our longest development cycles to date since we&#8217;ve gone 1.0. By bringing on Paul and Boone we&#8217;re going to ramp up production and set our sights on the next major version somewhere around the end of 2010.</p>\n<p>Have fun and thanks for using BuddyPress!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 01:16:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"John James Jacoby";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Matt: Mashable Interview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=35908";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://ma.tt/2010/10/mashable-interview/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:305:"<p>Sarah Kessler at Mashable did an interview with me she&#8217;s posted under the title <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/20/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-interview/">WordPress Founder on the Key to Open Source Success</a>.

Just register for a free account and create a new event.  Once your event has been setup, click the &#8220;Create Widgets Now&#8221; button.  Customize your widget in step 1, select WordPress in step 2, copy the code in step 3, but forget about step 4. Just go to Appearance/Widgets in your WordPress admin panel, drag a text widget to your sidebar, title it or leave the title blank, paste the code into the body of the widget, and click &#8220;Save.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Your visitors will now be able to donate and view your fundraising progress from your sidebar.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re curious to read your posts for this year&#8217;s Blog

class="fb-like"></p><p>Like any web platform, application, or operating system, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> can be hit by sudden unexpected problems.  Fortunately, general troubleshooting is easy and will usually reveal the source of (and sometimes fix) most problems.  Before we continue to general troubleshooting, there are a few popular cases that have relatively specific fixes.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re seeing a blank white screen, consult <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/08/17/wordpress-and-the-white-screen-of-death/">WordPress and the White Screen of Death</a>.  If you&#8217;re seeing &#8220;Fatal error: Allowed memory size,&#8221; consult <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/08/29/wordpress-and-the-fatal-memory-error/">WordPress and the Fatal Memory Error</a>.  If you&#8217;re seeing an internal server error or error 500, consult <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/09/10/wordpress-and-the-internal-server-error/">WordPress and the Internal Server Error</a>.  And, if you&#8217;re seeing a headers already sent warning, consult <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/09/16/wordpress-and-the-headers-already-sent-warning/">WordPress and the Headers Already Sent Warning</a>.</p>\n<p>As you can probably guess from the articles linked to above, many sudden WordPress problems can be traced back to plugins, themes, or corrupt core files.  If your problem is not directly related to one of these cases, it&#8217;s time to move through the general troubleshooting steps to find the cause of the problem and maybe even fix it along the way.</p>\n<p>If you have access to your admin panel, try deactivating all plugins.  If you don&#8217;t have access to your admin panel, try <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Troubleshooting#How_to_deactivate_all_plugins_when_not_able_to_access_the_administrative_menus.3F">manually resetting your plugins</a>.  If that resolves the issue, reactivate each one individually until you find the cause.</p>\n<p>If your blog showed no signs of improvement after deactivating your plugins, then it&#8217;s time to move on to your currently active theme.  If you have access to your admin panel, try switching to the Default theme (WordPress 1.5 &#8211; 2.9.2) or the Twenty Ten theme (WordPress 3.0 and higher).  If you don&#8217;t have access to your admin panel, access your server via <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FTP_Clients">FTP or SFTP</a>, navigate to /wp-content/themes/ and rename the directory of your currently active theme. This will force the Default theme (WordPress 1.5 &#8211; 2.9.2) or the Twenty Ten theme (WordPress 3.0 and higher) to activate and hopefully rule-out a theme-specific issue.</p>\n<p>If your blog showed no signs of improvement after deactivating your plugins and switching your theme, try <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">downloading WordPress</a> again and delete then replace your copies of everything <strong>except</strong> the wp-config.php file and the /wp-content/ directory with fresh copies from the download. This will effectively replace all of your core files without damaging your content and settings. Some uploaders tend to be unreliable when overwriting files, so don&#8217;t forget to delete the original files before replacing them.</p>\n<p>If the general troubleshooting steps have failed to identify the cause of the problem, the volunteers in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">WordPress Support Forums</a> will be more than happy to help you, especially if you list all the steps you have taken so far.</p>\n<a href="http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweblogtoolscollection.com%2F%3Fp%3D8829&count=horizontal&related=weblogtooltips%3Alaughinglizard&text=WordPress%20General%20Troubleshooting" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 13:00:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"James Huff";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"Dougal Campbell: WordPress and Drupal: Convergence?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"http://dougal.gunters.org/?p=26888";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:129:"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2010/10/13/wordpress-and-drupal-convergence?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8745:"<div><img width="131" height="150" src="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/WP-Drupal-131x150.png" class="attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="WP-Drupal" title="WP-Drupal" /></div><p>Obviously, as a once-upon-a-time core developer for the project, and as someone who continues to work in that community, I am pretty familiar with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. There&#8217;s hardly a day that goes by that I&#8217;m not hip-deep in WordPress code and news. I&#8217;ve watched its evolution over these past 7+ years as it has moved from a simple blogging system towards becoming a more full-featured <acronym title="Content Management System"><span class="caps">CMS</span></acronym>.</p>\n<p>Before WordPress was born, I was searching for a platform to build my own site on. I was waffling over <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2002/11/12/software-development">whether to write my own</a> from scratch or to use an already existing program. One of the projects I looked at early on was <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> (in fact, <a title="Dougal on drupal.org" href="http://drupal.org/user/1313">my drupal.org user account</a> is 2 years older than <a title="Dougal on wordpress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/dougal">my wordpress.org account</a>). It was kind of interesting, from a philosophical/architectural point of view, but it wasn&#8217;t easy to set up and use. I tinkered with it briefly, shrugged, and moved on to inspect the next tool for consideration.</p>\n<p>In recent years, my wife, <a title="Susan Campbell on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/suzecampbell">Susan</a>, began using Drupal at her job, which brought me a couple of opportunities to look at it when she had questions that she thought I could help her with. When I watched her configuring her Drupal sites, I could see that while it had some nice architectural features, it still had a steep learning curve. So when the <a title="Drupal 7 User Experience project" href="http://www.d7ux.org/">D7UX initiative</a> came around, with the goal of making Drupal 7 easier to use through a new-and-improved interface, it piqued my interest. Also, Susan has been involved with the organization of <a title="DrupalCamp Atlanta" href="http://drupalcampatlanta.com/">DrupalCamp Atlanta</a> for its first two years (as the voice of the <a title="DrupalCamp Atlanta on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/DrupalCamp_ATL">@DrupalCamp_ATL</a> account, AKA &#8220;Drupal Peachy Head&#8221;). So I&#8217;ve gone with her to those two DrupalCamp events, and had the opportunity to learn more about that <acronym title="Content Management System"><span class="caps">CMS</span></acronym>.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;m still not terribly familiar with actually using Drupal, though I did finally install D7-alpha-6 on my laptop recently. But I have had the opportunity to observe its community some &#8212; online, in person, and through podcasts &#8212; and I&#8217;ve learned a little bit about how they manage the release of a new version. And so I have a <em>pretty</em> good perspective on comparing some traits the WordPress and Drupal communities. I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again: there is a lot we can learn from each other, and I think that it is a win-win for the community in doing so.</p>\n<p>First of all, what can Drupal learn from WordPress? Well the main thing is one that they are already working on: they should improve their user interface. It&#8217;s no secret that probably one of the biggest factors of the success and popularity of WordPress is that it is so darned easy to use. It starts with &#8220;the famous 5-minute install&#8221;. You don&#8217;t have to be any kind of technical wizard to set up WordPress. Pretty much all you need to get started is the database information that will be provided by your hosting company in most cases. And then once you&#8217;re past the install phase, the rest of the software is pretty intuitive. The ability to upgrade plugins, themes, and even the core system itself at the click of a button is icing on the cake.</p>\n<p>This slideshow presentation from Jen Lampton makes most of the salient points:</p>\n<div id="__ss_4830309"><strong><a title="Why Drupal Should Be More Like WordPress" href="http://www.slideshare.net/jenlampton/wordpress-is-better-than-drupal-developers-take-note-4830309">Why Drupal Should Be More Like WordPress</a></strong></p>\n<div>View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jenlampton">Jen Lampton</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>And what can WordPress learn from Drupal? They have a really solid core architecture with amazing introspection capabilities. The Features module for Drupal makes it easy to export modules &#8212; along with their dependencies, configuration, and data &#8212; from one installation to another. WordPress will be hard-pressed (no pun intended) to emulate something like that for many versions to come. Drupal has automated runs of unit tests whenever someone contributes a patch for core or a module, giving developers almost instant feedback of problems and regressions. It is common for Drupal developers to build modules which do nothing more than provide infrastructure and APIs for <em>other</em> modules to leverage. Having a dependencies system in place makes this possible.</p>\n<p>Drupal developers will sometimes scoff at WordPress and deride it as &#8220;just a blogging platform&#8221;. WordPress developers might point out how hard it is to do certain tasks in Drupal which just work &#8220;right out of the box&#8221;  in WordPress. But some of those same Drupal developers look at how easy WordPress is, or how popular it is, and feel a little jealous. A few WordPress devs recognize our lack of database independence, dependency checking, or flexible <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator"><span class="caps">URL</span></acronym> routing, and wish we could push these things into core now.</p>\n<p>Drupal devs note that WordPress has been beefing up its custom taxonomy and content type support, and say that WordPress is just copying Drupal. WordPress devs point out how often Drupal gets compared to WordPress when discussions of good <acronym title="User Interface"><span class="caps">UI</span></acronym> come up, or tout how even Mark Boulton Design <a href="http://www.d7ux.org/why-is-this-on-wordpress/">put their D7UX blog in WordPress to start with</a>, because it was easier to use than Drupal at the time.</p>\n<p>But I think these changes are a pretty natural evolution for both systems. If you could imagine &#8220;The Perfect <acronym title="Content Management System"><span class="caps">CMS</span></acronym>&#8221;, what would it be like? It would be easy to use, and it would be full of powerful features, right? It would be lovely to look at, and it would have a strong underlying architecture and <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym>.</p>\n<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-26892" href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2010/10/13/wordpress-and-drupal-convergence/wordpress-vs-drupal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26892" title="WordPress vs Drupal" src="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/WordPress-vs-Drupal.png" alt="" width="400" height="420" /></a>I think WordPress and Drupal are both heading in that direction &#8212; they just had different starting points. WordPress started with good usability, but a limited architecture and feature set. Drupal started with a strong architecture, but a very developer-centric user experience. But WordPress has  been steadily improving its architecture. And Drupal has been working on its <acronym title="User Interface"><span class="caps">UI</span></acronym>. They had different origins, and they have taken different paths, but they are both evolving towards <acronym title="Content Management System"><span class="caps">CMS</span></acronym> Nirvana. And we users get to ride along.</p>\n<p>If you could bring a feature from one system to the other, what would it be?</p>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a

This site is a very good initiative and there are three compelling reasons why you should register and vote.<br />\n<span id="more-8817"></span></p>\n<h3>Reason 1: you can&#8217;t beat &#8220;free&#8221;</h3>\n<p>This one is pretty obvious: there are plenty of stuff to win, and <strong>you</strong> might win one. Check out the <a href="http://2010.wphonors.com/sponsors/">Sponsors</a> page and peruse the growing list of goodies provided by several benefactors of our community. Vote and one could be yours. Not interested in any prize? Vote anyway, win one and sell it during your next front yard sell!</p>\n<h3>Reason 2: it&#8217;s good for the community</h3>\n<p>Our community consists in users using products, and authors crafting those products (themes, plugins, tutorials and news sites&#8230;). This event is an occasion for users to show their support, admiration, thankfulness or love to makers. Some of the products in our community are commercial and as such require a financial effort, but most are free and don&#8217;t get too many feedback on how users are pleased to use them. And anyway this is not about money here: this is about love. Tell makers you love them. Vote for them. And if your favorite product maker is not nominated yet, submit them.</p>\n<h3>Reason 3: it&#8217;s custom post types</h3>\n<p>That is actually my personal favorite reason why you should <a href="http://2010.wphonors.com/wp-login.php">register</a> to the site.</p>\n<p>A little background information for those who are starting to get lost? WordPress can register different types of posts, and uses internally a few of them: &#8220;posts&#8221; in the traditional way, &#8220;pages&#8221; as you know them, but also attachments, revisions and nav menus. Users and authors can also define <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Post_Types">custom post types</a> (sometimes referred to as CPT) to further extend the way they will manage their content with WordPress.</p>\n<p><img src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cpt.jpg" alt="" title="cpt" width="453" height="427" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8819" /></p>\n<p>The <a href="http://2010.wphonors.com/">2010 WordPress Honors</a> website makes good use of custom post types, to file Sites, Plugins, Themes and Personalities. You probably have seen a few tutorials already explaining how to implement CPT into your theme or plugin, but if you are not that tech savvy and just want to understand how the end result might look like and work, <a href="http://2010.wphonors.com/wp-login.php">register</a> and poke around the admin interface. Then, of course, browse the site itself and vote!</p>\n<a href="http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweblogtoolscollection.com%2F%3Fp%3D8817&count=horizontal&related=weblogtooltips%3Alaughinglizard&text=WordPress%20Honors%202010%3A%20Why%20You%20Should%20Register" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 14:40:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"Ozh";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress.com Launches Text Messaging Feature";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=8810";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/10/12/wordpress-com-launches-text-messaging-feature/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1378:"<p class="fb-like"></p><p><a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> has just launched <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/texting-its-now-for-blogging-too/">a new text messaging feature</a>. Users can now do a variety of blog management tasks via the new 77377 (PRESS) short code.</p>\n<p>By simply activating the service at Settings/Text Messaging in your admin panel, you can receive notifications when users are added or removed, and when the theme and privacy settings have changed.</p>\n<p>Users who choose to upgrade the service for only $20/year will be able to add extra protection to their blog via an SMS-enabled two-step login process, receive new comment notifications with the ability to moderate or reply via text message, receive new post notifications, and publish a post of 160 characters or less.</p>\n<p>This feature is only available in the USA, though the WordPress.com team will look into expanding the service to other countries if the feature proves popular enough.  As always, standard text messaging and data rates apply.</p>\n<p>What do you think of the new text messaging feature?</p>\n<a

feature that servers as a nifty bridge between your Gravatar and your <a href="http://blog.gravatar.com/2010/06/02/public-profiles-for-everyone/">Gravatar Profile</a>.</p>\n<p>Hovercards have already been enabled throughout <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a>, and there is an official plugin in the works, but what if you can&#8217;t wait for the official plugin to add Hovercards to your WordPress blog?</p>\n<p>If your theme has a functions.php file, just add the following line within the file:</p>\n<p><code>wp_enqueue_script( ''gprofiles'', ''http://s.gravatar.com/js/gprofiles.js'', array( ''jquery'' ), ''e'', true );</code></p>\n<p>If your theme doesn&#8217;t have a functions.php file, or you&#8217;d rather not mess with it, use a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Text_editor">plain text editor</a> to create a file called hovercards.php with the following content, then use an <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FTP_Clients">FTP or SFTP</a> client to upload it to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory, and activate it via the Plugins section of the admin panel.</p>\n<p><code>&lt;<em></em>?php<br />\n/*<br />\nPlugin Name: Hovercards<br />\n*/<br />\nwp_enqueue_script( ''gprofiles'', ''http://s.gravatar.com/js/gprofiles.js'', array( ''jquery'' ), ''e'', true );<br />\n?&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Credit for the above code goes entirely to <a href="http://ottopress.com/2010/gravatar-hovercards/">Otto</a> and <a href="http://ottopress.com/2010/gravatar-hovercards/comment-page-1/#comment-5288">Alex</a>. It is not official and not supported, so you should probably switch over to Gravatar&#8217;s official plugin when it&#8217;s released, but at least this will hold you over until then.</p>\n<p>What do you think of the new Hovercard feature?

post from <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Archives.showArchive&amp;author=2358">Philip Leigh</a> of MediaPost this week, titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=137079">The Implications Of Blogging</a>&#8220;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;Similarly, it&#8217;s likely that the future of blogging &#8212; and the future spread of knowledge &#8212; will reflect the characteristics of whatever blog platform achieves dominance. Increasingly <strong>it appears that the winner will be WordPress</strong>. It first appeared seven years ago as a successor to software typically used for online diaries. Thus, it was originally text-based, but has since evolved to also encompass audio, video, and animation. It has even become a popular platform for entire websites as well as important components of prominent sites such as The New York Times.  </p></blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis mine).  </p>\n<p>Philip goes on to state:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In short, WordPress is not merely a blogging tool. It&#8217;s a platform that can lead to an explosion of new media properties capable of text, video, audio, music, animation, interactivity, online merchandising, podcasting, and even social networking. Successful innovations will rapidly take root and expand while unsuccessful ones will quickly perish or remain marginal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>[ Read the full article on <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=137079">MediaPost.com</a> ]</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/wordpresspublishers.wordpress.com/1063/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=publisherblog.automattic.com&amp;blog=1470857&amp;post=1063&amp;subd=wordpresspublishers&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Oct 2010 23:51:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Raanan Bar-Cohen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"Weblog Tools Collection: 2010 WordPress Honors Seeking Submissions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=8784";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/10/08/2010-wordpress-honors-seeking-submissions/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:840:"<p class="fb-like"></p><p>The <a href="http://2010.wphonors.com/">2010 WordPress Honors</a> launched earlier this week and is currently seeking submissions and votes for your favorite <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> plugins, themes, sites, and personalities.</p>\n<p>Final voting will begin once the nominees have been announced in mid November, and the winners will be announced in early January.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s your take on award ceremonies like this?

It&#8217;s now easy to find out about who is behind your favorite comments on WordPress.com simply by moving your mouse over their Gravatar.  This new feature is enabled by default across WordPress.com.</p>\n<h3>What’s a Hovercard?</h3>\n<p>Gravatar Hovercards show information about a person: name, bio, pictures, and their contact info at other services they use on the web like Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter" title="kristin_hovercard" src="http://en.blog.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kristin_hovercard.png?w=531&#038;h=274" alt="" width="531" height="274" /></p>\n<p>As a commenter, Hovercards offer a great way to show your Internet presence and help people find your own blog. If you&#8217;re a blogger on WordPress.com, you can quickly check out who’s commenting on your blog, and have an easier time connecting with them.</p>\n<h3>How to use and see Hovercards</h3>\n<p>You can see other people&#8217;s Hovercards by moving your mouse over their Gravatar picture in comments on any WordPress.com blog, and after a moment the Hovercard will appear.

We want users to have flexibility when choosing a host for their precious content. Because of this strategy, WordPress runs pretty much anywhere. Web hosting platforms, however, change over time, and we occasionally are able to reevaluate some of the requirements for running WordPress. Now is one of those times. You probably guessed it from the title &#8212; we&#8217;re finally ready to announce the end of support for PHP 4 and MySQL 4!</p>\n<p>First up, the announcement that developers really care about. WordPress 3.1, due in late 2010, will be the last version of WordPress to support PHP 4.</p>\n<p>For WordPress 3.2, due in the first half of 2011, we will be raising the minimum required PHP version to 5.2. Why 5.2? Because that&#8217;s what the vast majority of WordPress users are using, and it offers substantial improvements over earlier PHP 5 releases. It is also the minimum PHP version that the <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> projects will be supporting in their next versions, both due out this year.</p>\n<p>The numbers are now, <em>finally</em>, strongly in favor of this move. Only around 11 percent of WordPress installs are running on a PHP version below 5.2. Many of them are on hosts who support PHP 5.2 &#8212; users merely need to change a setting in their hosting control panel to activate it. We believe that percentage will only go down over the rest of the year as hosting providers realize that to support the newest versions of WordPress (or Drupal, or Joomla), they&#8217;re going to have to pull the trigger.</p>\n<p>In less exciting news, we are also going to be dropping support for MySQL 4 after WordPress 3.1. Fewer than 6 percent of WordPress users are running MySQL 4. The new required MySQL version for WordPress 3.2 will be 5.0.15.</p>\n<p>WordPress users will not be able to upgrade to WordPress 3.2 if their hosting environment does not meet these requirements (the built-in updater will prevent it). In order to determine which versions your host provides, we&#8217;ve created the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/health-check/">Health Check plugin</a>. You can download it manually, or use this <a href="http://coveredwebservices.com/wp-plugin-install/?plugin=health-check">handy plugin installation</a> tool I whipped up. Right now, Health Check will only tell you if you&#8217;re ready for WordPress 3.2. In a future release it will provide all sorts of useful information about your server and your WordPress install, so hang on to it!</p>\n<p>In summary: WordPress 3.1, due in late 2010, will be the last version of WordPress to support PHP 4 and MySQL 4. WordPress 3.2, due in the first half of 2011, will require PHP 5.2 or higher, and MySQL 5.0.15 or higher. <a href="http://coveredwebservices.com/wp-plugin-install/?plugin=health-check">Install the Health Check plugin</a> to see if you&#8217;re ready!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:44:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"100 Million Plugin Downloads and Counting";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/100-million/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/100-million/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Jul 2010 17:48:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=1429";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:364:"WordPress 3.0 Thelonious passed 3 million downloads yesterday, and today the plugin directory followed suit with a milestone of its own: 100 million downloads.

So we&#8217;re taking the next two months to concentrate on improving WordPress.org. A major part of that will be improving the infrastructure of the plugins directory. More than 10,000 plugins are in the directory, every one of them GPL compatible and free as in both beer and speech. Here&#8217;s what we have in mind:</p>\n<p>We want to provide developers the tools they need to build the best possible plugins. We&#8217;re going to provide better integration with the forums so you can support your users. We&#8217;ll make more statistics available to you so you can analyze your user base, and over time we hope to make it easier for you to manage, build, and release localized plugins.</p>\n<p>We want to improve how the core software works with your plugin and the plugin directory. We&#8217;re going to focus on ensuring seamless upgrades by making the best possible determinations about compatibility, and offer continual improvements to the plugin installer. And we also want to give you a better developer tool set like SVN notifications and improvements to the bug tracker.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also going to experiment with other great ideas to help the community help plugin authors. We want it to be easy for you to offer comments to plugin authors and the community, including user reviews and better feedback. We may experiment with an adoption process for abandoned plugins as a way to revitalize hidden gems in the directory.

Here are the WordCamps scheduled for this summer, along with what I know about them.</p>\n<p>July 3: <a href="http://wordcamp.de/">WordCamp Germany</a> &#8211; Berlin, Germany. I love it that they&#8217;re using BuddyPress for their event site. They have multiple tracks, and what looks to be a nice variety of sessions. It&#8217;s only a few days away, so if you&#8217;re thinking of going, get your tickets now!</p>\n<p>July 10: <a href="http://2010.boulder.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Boulder</a> &#8211; Boulder, Colorado, USA. This was WordCamp Denver last year, but the organizers have decided to mix it up and go back and forth between Denver and Boulder, which also has a thriving tech community. This year the venue is the Boulder Theater (so pretty!), and there will sessions for bloggers and devs alike, plus a Genius Bar to help people get their WordPress sites all fixed up. The speaker lineup looks good, and I hear they&#8217;re pumping up the wifi this year. I&#8217;ll be there, likely hunched over a notebook with Lisa Sabin-Wilson (author of <em>WordPress for Dummies</em> and <em>BuddyPress for Dummies</em>) to talk about the WordPress User Handbook project, and/or hunched over a sketchbook with Kevin Conboy (designed the new lighter &#8220;on&#8221; state for admin menus in WordPress 3.0) to work out a new default WordCamp.org theme (using BuddyPress). You can still get tickets!</p>\n<p>July 17–18: <a href="http://uk.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp UK</a>- Manchester, England, UK. The roving WordCamp UK will be in Manchester this year, and is probably the closest to BarCamp style of all the WordCamps, using a wiki to plan some speakers/sessions and organizing the rest ad-hoc on the first day of the event. I&#8217;ll be attending this one as well, and am looking forward to seeing WordPress lead developer Peter Westwood again. I&#8217;m also looking forward to meeting some core contributors for the first time in person, like Simon Wheatley and John O&#8217;Nolan. Mike Little, co-founder of WordPress, is on the organizing team of WordCamp UK. Tickets on sale now!</p>\n<p>July 24: WordCamp Nigeria &#8211; Lagos, Nigeria. Their site seems to have a virus, so no link from here, but if you&#8217;re in Nigeria and interested in attending/getting involved, a quick Google search will get you to the organizers.</p>\n<p>August 7: <a href="http://www.wordcamphouston.com/">WordCamp Houston</a> &#8211; Houston, TX, USA. Houston, Texas, birthplace of WordPress! Fittingly, Matt Mullenweg will be there to give the keynote. WordCamp Houston is running three tracks &#8212; Business, Blogger and Developer &#8212; in recognition of the fact that people who are interested in using WordPress for their business may not actually be bloggers or developers themselves. This used to get labeled as a &#8220;CMS&#8221; track at previous WordCamps (including NYC 2009), but with WordPress 3.0 supporting CMS functionality out of the box, &#8220;Business&#8221; is a much more appropriate label. Who wants to bet on if there will be BBQ for lunch?</p>\n<p>August 7 : <a href="http://wordcampiowa.org/">WordCamp  Iowa</a> &#8211; Des Moines, Iowa, USA. Another placeholder page. Happening, not happening? I&#8217;ve emailed the organizer and will update this post once I know more.</p>\n<p>August 7–8: <a href="http://wordcamp.org.nz/">WordCamp  New Zealand</a> &#8211; Auckland, New Zealand. They haven&#8217;t announced this year&#8217;s speakers or topics, but they&#8217;ve been running polls to get community input into the program. Of note: in 2011 WordCamp New Zealand will be shifting seasons and will be in February instead, when the weather is nicer.</p>\n<p>August 20–22: <a href="http://2010.savannah.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Savannah</a> &#8211; Savannah, Georgia, USA. Disclaimer: I am completely biased about Savannah, since I&#8217;m one of the organizers. This will be the first WordCamp in Savannah, and it&#8217;s being held at the Savannah College of Art and Design River Club, an awesome venue that used to be a cotton warehouse or something like that. Since Savannah doesn&#8217;t really have a cohesive WordPress community yet (though a fair number of people from Savannah attended WordCamp Atlanta earlier this year), this WordCamp is aimed squarely at building a local community. We&#8217;ll have a local meet-and-greet, regular sessions with visiting speakers (lots of core contributors coming to this one, plus Matt), and on Sunday it will be combination unconference/genius bar/collaborative workspace. Oh, and a potluck! We&#8217;ll also be running a pre-WordCamp workshop for people who have never used WordPress but want to get started, so that they&#8217;ll be able to follow the presentations and conversations littered with WordPress-specific vocabulary over the weekend. Ticket sales just opened, so get your tickets now.</p>\n<p>For a <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/">schedule of all upcoming WordCamps</a>, visit <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">wordcamp.org</a>.

Developers and network admins will appreciate the long-awaited <strong>merge of MU and WordPress</strong>, creating the new multi-site functionality which makes it possible to run one blog or ten million from the same installation. As a user, you will love the new <strong>lighter interface</strong>, the contextual help on every screen, the <strong>1,217 bug fixes and feature enhancements</strong>, bulk updates so you can upgrade 15 plugins at once with a single click, and blah blah blah just watch the video. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' />   <em>(In HD, if you can, so you can catch the Easter eggs.)</em></p>\n<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="360" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="flashvars" value="guid=BQtfIEY1&amp;width=640&amp;height=360&amp;locksize=no&amp;dynamicseek=false&amp;qc_publisherId=p-18-mFEk4J448M" /><param name="src" value="http://v.wordpress.com/wp-content/plugins/video/flvplayer.swf?ver=1.21" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" src="http://v.wordpress.com/wp-content/plugins/video/flvplayer.swf?ver=1.21" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent" flashvars="guid=BQtfIEY1&amp;width=640&amp;height=360&amp;locksize=no&amp;dynamicseek=false&amp;qc_publisherId=p-18-mFEk4J448M"></embed></object></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to embed the WordPress 3.0 video tour in your blog, copy and paste this code for the high quality version:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml;">&lt;embed src=&quot;http://v.wordpress.com/wp-content/plugins/video/flvplayer.swf?ver=1.21&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; seamlesstabbing=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; overstretch=&quot;true&quot; flashvars=&quot;guid=BQtfIEY1&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;height=360&amp;amp;locksize=no&amp;amp;dynamicseek=false&amp;amp;qc_publisherId=p-18-mFEk4J448M&quot; title=&quot;Introducing WordPress 3.0 &amp;quot;Thelonious&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;</pre>\n<p>For a more comprehensive look at everything that has improved in 3.0 check out <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0">3.0&#8242;s Codex page</a> or the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?group=status&amp;milestone=3.0&amp;desc=1&amp;order=priority">long list of issues in Trac</a>. (We&#8217;re trying to keep these announcement posts shorter.) Whew! That&#8217;s a lot packed into one release. I can&#8217;t think of a better  way to kick off the 3.X cycle we&#8217;ll be in for the next two and a half  years.</p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>Normally this is where I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re about to start work on 3.1, but we&#8217;re actually not. We&#8217;re going to take a release cycle off to focus on all of the things around WordPress. The growth of the community has been breathtaking, including over 10.3 million downloads of version 2.9, but so much of our effort has been focused on the core software it hasn&#8217;t left much time for anything else. Over the next three months we&#8217;re going to split into ninja/pirate teams focused on different areas of the around-WordPress experience, including the showcase, Codex, forums, profiles, update and compatibility APIs, theme directory, plugin directory, mailing lists, core plugins, wordcamp.org&#8230; the possibilities are endless. The goal of the teams isn&#8217;t going to be to make things perfect all at once, just better than they are today. We think this investment of time will give us a much stronger infrastructure to grow WordPress.org for the many tens of millions of users that will join us during the 3.X release cycle.</p>\n<h3>It Takes a Village</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m proud to acknowledge the contributions of the following <strong>218</strong> people to the 3.0 release cycle. These are the folks that make WordPress what it is, whose collaboration and hard work enable us to build something greater than the sum of our parts.

That’s part of the community involvement as well &#8212; we expect that those who pitch in will also help shape the process.</p>\n<p>What’s involved in reviewing themes for the directory? There are some obvious things, such as being familiar with PHP and WordPress theme code (and the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development_Checklist">theme development checklist</a>), with an eye for security issues. You would also need to have the ability to set up a separate install of the latest version of WordPress for testing theme submissions.</p>\n<p>Hopefully a few talented theme developers are reading this right now and saying to themselves, &#8220;I’d love to help!

Yay!</li>\n<li>Multi-site is all set.</li>\n<li>The look of the WordPress admin has been lightened up a little bit, so you can focus more on your content.</li>\n<li>There are a ton of changes, so plugin authors, please test your plugins <strong>now</strong>, so that if there is a compatibility issue, we can figure it out before the final release.</li>\n<li>Plugin and theme *users* are also encouraged to test things out.

The term sheet is the investors offer and outlines the main terms of the deal including amount of investment, valuation and other terms and conditions\r\n<strong>Due diligence:</strong> Investors need key financial, legal and commercial information before committing to the finance. It’s a rigorous process but essential to reassure your investors of a sound offer.\r\n<strong>Post finance:</strong> A stage people do not always consider when the main focus is winning the money.

Atlas approached Sherpa with a business concept based on their experience with a leading corporate cloud computing provider. \r\n\r\nSherpa provided interim management at the critical stages of early growth in sales and finance to support the management team, filling skills gaps until the business could afford a full time solution. Through Sherpa’s investor readiness programme, Atlas has successfully raised its first round of funding, with further angel investment and wider VC interest secured for the second round. \r\n\r\n<strong>Background:</strong> The founders of Atlas were looking to build a business using their experience in the corporate market to provide a solution to SME’s through a utility based pricing model. They needed to test the viability of the product and service in the market place and build a business case to take the product to market. \r\n\r\nThey also needed to raise finance across three stages to build the business infrastructure, get early traction in the market and build a management team. The team needed to be sure the project was going to be a success as they were leaving lucrative, well paid jobs in large corporate companies.\r\n\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> When starting a new business, the lack of balance or ability to build a brand, close deals and manage a tight cash flow is daunting. Sherpa added value and balance to the team operationally as well as strategically to accelerate growth and mitigate risk at this difficult early stage.\r\n\r\n<strong>Commercialisation</strong>\r\nSherpa supported Atlas through the entire commercialisation process including market research and feasibility, building the business case, financial modelling to securing first clients. \r\n\r\n<strong>Interim Management</strong>\r\nActing in an interim capacity to the business, Sherpa added drive and motivation to the management team to give them the confidence to make the change. Sherpa provided the contacts, tenacity and flexibility to add value to the project from concept development to first sales. The process worked because of the development of the strategy and building the business case. The rapid growth was the ability of the team to execute the plan.\r\n\r\n<strong>Financial Modelling</strong>\r\nWith a capital high fronted the model investors need a robust plan to secure the high upfront cost of of funding. Attracting appropriate angel investment with the cultural fit and door opeing capability will be a further catalyst to rapid growth.\r\n\r\nContact Sherpa on <strong>0191 211 1995</strong> to arrange your free no obligation consultation.

Sherpa provided the contacts, tenacity and flexibility to add value to the project from concept development to first sales. The process worked because of the development of the strategy and building the business case. The rapid growth was the ability of the team to execute the plan.\n\n<strong>Financial Modelling</strong>\nWith a capital high fronted the model investors need a robust plan to secure the high upfront cost of of funding.

In many companies, it can be relatively simple for the management structure to slip into an introverted and staid approach to business. It is fairly common for traditional, family owned businesses to fall into the trap of “we’ve always done it this way – why should we change”.\r\n\r\nA non executive director however can often see risks and opportunities in the market place that are sometimes overlooked by the executive management. This is because they are not wrapped up in the day-to-day running of the business. A non executive director can, therefore, step back from the stress of every day business life and see things from a different perspective. They can provide a vital strategic overview.\r\n\r\nThe role of a non executive director can be particularly important when the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer of a company is especially entrepreneurial or overbearing. Non executive directors can have an influence to moderate a Chief Executive Officer who is doing the business for his own ego or financial benefit and not those of the shareholders.\r\n\r\nIn other companies, there could be the opposite problem - in that the non executive director is brought in because the organisation lacks the entrepreneurial flair, international connections or drive and dynamism to compete in the modern day market place.\r\n\r\nSome companies require non executive directors to see them through a corporate transition such as a change in ownership and the non executive director may bring highly specialised knowledge invaluable to a company going through a flotation, relocation, rebuilding programmes and/or strategic alliance.\r\n\r\nAt its simplest level, a non executive director might just be brought in to fill a temporary shortage of in-house qualified directors.', 'Non Executive Directors', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '153-revision-9', '', '', '2010-10-29 10:47:56', '2010-10-29 10:47:56', '', 153, 'http://www.sherpabusinessconsultancy.com/wordpress/business-consultancy/153-revision-9.html', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In many companies, it can be relatively simple for the management structure to slip into an introverted and staid approach to business. It is fairly common for traditional, family owned businesses to fall into the trap of “we’ve always done it this way – why should we change”.\r\n\r\nA non executive director however can often see risks and opportunities in the market place that are sometimes overlooked by the executive management. This is because they are not wrapped up in the day-to-day running of the business. A non executive director can, therefore, step back from the stress of every day business life and see things from a different perspective. They can provide a vital strategic overview.\r\n\r\nThe role of a non executive director can be particularly important when the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer of a company is especially entrepreneurial or overbearing. Non executive directors can have an influence to moderate a Chief Executive Officer who is doing the business for his own ego or financial benefit and not those of the shareholders.\r\n\r\nIn other companies, there could be the opposite problem - in that the non executive director is brought in because the organisation lacks the entrepreneurial flair, international connections or drive and dynamism to compete in the modern day market place.\r\n\r\nSome companies require non executive directors to see them through a corporate transition such as a change in ownership and the non executive director may bring highly specialised knowledge invaluable to a company going through a flotation, relocation, rebuilding programmes and/or strategic alliance.\r\n\r\nAt its simplest level, a non executive director might just be brought in to fill a temporary shortage of in-house qualified directors.', 'Non Executive Directors', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '153-revision-7', '', '', '2010-10-08 14:34:01', '2010-10-08 14:34:01', '', 153, 'http://www.sherpabusinessconsultancy.com/wordpress/business-consultancy/153-revision-7.html', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

If you want to raise money for your business, Sherpa can help you through the process. \n\nSherpa act on a consultancy or interim basis to help you work with investors and VC’s. Raising finance is a lengthy and time consuming process and you can easily lose focus on the actual business. Having short term, expert support throughout the process helps you stay on track while staying focused on the business and the execution of the plan. We add value to help you recruit a senior team, find strategic partners and make early stage client introductions.\n\n\nIf you have no experience of raising finance there are a number of things you need to consider and prepare for.\n\n<strong>A compelling business plan:</strong> An investor level business plan is likely to be very different to the business plans you are familiar with. There is a great deal of work to be done in terms of getting your business in order, shaping the offer and financial projections.\n<strong>Finding the right funding or VC:</strong> It’s essential to research and select the right fund or investor for your business. This is determined by the size of investment, which industry and meeting the requirements of the investors.\n<strong>Due diligence:</strong> Investors need key financial, legal and commercial information before committing to the finance. It’s a rigorous process but essential to reassure your investors of a sound offer.\n<strong>Term sheet:</strong> agreeing the principles of the deal – amount of investment, valuation and other terms and conditions\n<strong>Post finance:</strong> A stage people do not always consider when the main focus is winning the money. Investors want transparent information and quality management reporting so they have visibility in the business. An interim finance director helps you develop robust systems and processes to make sure the money is managed and the team is accountable against the plan.\n\n\n', 'Investment & Venture Capital ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '149-autosave', '', '', '2010-10-29 11:03:54', '2010-10-29 11:03:54', '', 149, 'http://www.sherpabusinessconsultancy.com/wordpress/business-consultancy/149-autosave.html', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(858, 1, '2010-10-28 14:24:57', '2010-10-28 14:24:57', 'Non executive directors can be extremely useful to any company. In many companies, it can be relatively simple for the management structure to slip into an introverted and staid approach to business. It is fairly common for traditional, family owned businesses to fall into the trap of “we’ve always done it this way – why should we change”.\r\n\r\nA non executive director however can often see risks and opportunities in the market place that are sometimes overlooked by the executive management. This is because they are not wrapped up in the day-to-day running of the business. A non executive director can, therefore, step back from the stress of every day business life and see things from a different perspective. They can provide a vital strategic overview.\r\n\r\nThe role of a non executive director can be particularly important when the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer of a company is especially entrepreneurial or overbearing.

Atlas approached Sherpa with a business concept based on their experience with a leading corporate cloud computing provider. \r\n\r\nSherpa provided interim management at the critical stages of early growth in sales and finance to support the management team, filling skills gaps until the business could afford a full time solution. Through Sherpa’s investor readiness programme, Atlas has successfully raised its first round of funding, with further angel investment and wider VC interest secured for the second round. \r\n\r\n<strong>Background:</strong> The founders of Atlas were looking to build a business using their experience in the corporate market to provide a solution to SME’s through a utility based pricing model. They needed to test the viability of the product and service in the market place and build a business case to take the product to market. \r\n\r\nThey also needed to raise finance across three stages to build the business infrastructure, get early traction in the market and build a management team. The team needed to be sure the project was going to be a success as they were leaving lucrative, well paid jobs in large corporate companies.\r\n\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> When starting a new business, the lack of balance or ability to build a brand, close deals and manage a tight cash flow is daunting. Sherpa added value and balance to the team operationally as well as strategically to accelerate growth and mitigate risk at this difficult early stage.\r\n\r\n<strong>Commercialisation</strong>\r\nSherpa supported Atlas through the entire commercialisation process including market research and feasibility, building the business case, financial modelling to securing first clients. \r\n\r\n<strong>Interim Management</strong>\r\nActing in an interim capacity to the business, Sherpa added drive and motivation to the management team to give them the confidence to make the change. Sherpa provided the contacts, tenacity and flexibility to add value to the project from concept development to first sales. The process worked because of the development of the strategy and building the business case. The rapid growth was the ability of the team to execute the plan.\r\n\r\n<strong>Financial Modelling</strong>\r\nWith a capital high fronted the model investors need a robust plan to secure the high upfront cost of of funding.
